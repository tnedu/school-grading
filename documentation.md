## A-F School Grading Model

This page outlines our final model for A-F school grading.

First, identify F Schools which are 5 percent of lowest performing schools based on a three year success rate without a Level 4 or 5 school composite TVAAS in each of the two most recent years AND schools with a graduation rate below 67 percent. Success rates for this purpose includes percent of students earning an ACT composite score of 21 or above.

Identify 5 percent of schools by grade pool, where High Schools are schools with at least 30 students in the graduating cohort, and K-8 schools are all others.

### Achievement Score

Next, assess schools based on the following indicators based on All Students performance:

|   | Achievement (% O/M) | TVAAS | Ready Graduate | Opportunity to Learn | ELPA |
|---|---------------------|-------|----------------|----------------------|------|
| A | Top Quintile Success Rate OR 12.5% Growth | Level 5 | [50, 100] OR 12.5% Growth | [0, 8] OR 12.5% Reduction in Chronic Absence | [36, 100] Percent Exit OR [70, 100] Meet Growth Standard |
| B | 2nd Quintile Success Rate OR 6.25% Growth | Level 4 | (35, 50) OR 6.25% Growth | [8, 12] OR 6.25% Reduction in Chronic Absence | [24, 36) Percent Exit OR [60, 70) Meet Growth Standard |
| C | 3rd Quintile Success Rate OR 6.25% Growth with Upper Bound CI | Level 3 | (28, 35] OR Greater than Prior Year | (12, 17] OR 6.25% Reduction in Chronic Absence with Lower Bound CI | [12, 24) Percent Exit OR [45, 60) Meet Growth Standard |
| D | 4th Quintile Success Rate OR Less than 6.25% Growth with Upper Bound CI | Level 2 | (15, 30) OR Same as Prior Year | (17, 24] OR Less than 6.25% Reduction in Chronic Absence with Lower Bound CI | [6, 12) Percent Exit OR [30, 45) Meet Growth Standard |
| F | Bottom Quintile Success Rate OR Upper Bound CI <= Prior Year % P/A | Level 1 | [0, 15] OR Less than Prior Year | (24, 100] OR Lower Bound CI >= Prior Year Chronic Absence | [0, 6) Percent Exit OR [0, 30) Meet Growth Standard |

A school receives a grade corresponding to the highest condition met for each indicator. For instance, a school with a success rate at the 50th percentile but which shows 12.5% growth from the prior year receives an A grade for Achievement. Schools only receive a grade for Achievement, Readiness, ELPA and Absenteeism if they can be evaluated for both the absolute and AMO components.

Success rates for the Achievement indicator includes percent of students earning an ACT composite score of 21 or above. ELPA exit is weighted by time in ESL services.

For K-8 schools, indicators are weighted as follows: 45% Achievement, 35% Growth, 10% Opportunity to Learn, 10% ELPA. If a school does not meet a minimum n count for ELPA, the indicators are weighted as follows: 50% Achievement, 40% Growth, 10% Opportunity to Learn.

For high schools, indicators are weighted as follows: 30% Achievement, 25% Growth, 25% Ready Graduate, 10% Opportunity to Learn, 10% ELPA. If a school does not meet a minimum n count for ELPA, the indicators are weighted as follows: 35% Achievement, 30% Growth, 25% Ready Graduate, 10% Opportunity to Learn.

A school receive an overall Achievement score based on the weighted average of its achievement indicators, where grades map to numerical values as follows: A = 4, B = 3, C = 2, D = 1, F = 0.

### Gap Score

Next, assess schools based on the following indicators based on subgroup performance:

|   | Achievement | Growth | Ready Graduate | Opportunity to Learn | ELPA |
|---|-------------|--------|----------------|----------------------|------|
| A | Top Quintile Success Rate OR 12.5% Growth | Top Quintile in Moving Students to Higher Proficiency Band | [50, 100] OR 12.5% Growth | [0, 8] OR 12.5% Reduction in Chronic Absence | [36, 100] Percent Exit OR [70, 100] Meet Growth Standard |
| B | 2nd Quintile Success Rate OR 6.25% Growth | 2nd Quintile in Moving Students to Higher Proficiency Band | (35, 50) OR 6.25% Growth | [8, 12] OR 6.25% Reduction in Chronic Absence | [24, 36) Percent Exit OR [60, 70) Meet Growth Standard |
| C | 3rd Quintile Success Rate OR 6.25% Growth with Upper Bound CI | 3rd Quintile in Moving Students to Higher Proficiency Band | (28, 35] OR Greater than Prior Year | (12, 17] OR 6.25% Reduction in Chronic Absence with Lower Bound CI | [12, 24) Percent Exit OR [45, 60) Meet Growth Standard |
| D | 4th Quintile Success Rate OR Less than 6.25% Growth with Upper Bound CI | 4th Quintile in Moving Students to Higher Proficiency Band | (16, 28] OR Same as Prior Year | (17, 24] OR Less than 6.25% Reduction in Chronic Absence with Lower Bound CI | [6, 12) Percent Exit OR [30, 45) Meet Growth Standard |
| F | Bottom Quintile Success Rate OR Upper Bound CI <= Prior Year % P/A | Bottom Quintile in Moving Students to Higher Proficiency Band | [0, 16] OR Less than Prior Year | (24, 100] OR Lower Bound CI >= Prior Year Chronic Absence | [0, 6) Percent Exit OR [0, 30) Meet Growth Standard |

Indicators are weighted as for All Students. Each subgroup receives a score based on the weighted average of its indicators, where grades map to numerical values as follows: A = 4, B = 3, C = 2, D = 1, F = 0. A school's subgroup grades are averaged again, weighted by the total weight represented by the subgroup grade, to produce an overall subgroup score.

### Targeted Support Schools

Targeted support schools are 5 percent of schools with the lowest subgroup averages for each of BHN, ED, SWD, and EL subgroups. No corrections are made for overlap.

### Final Grade

A school's overall achievement and subgroup scores are weighted (60% achievement, 40% subgroup) and averaged to produce an overall average. The overall average maps to a final grade as follows:

+ (3, 4] = A
+ (2, 3] = B
+ (1, 2] = C
+ [0, 1] = D
+ Bottom 5% + Grad Rate Below 67% = F
